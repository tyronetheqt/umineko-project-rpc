# Umineko Project Discord RPC + Steam API Integration

hi you can have discord rich presence and steam api integration (assuming you own either questions or answers arc on steam)

to install:
1) download the rar from releases
2) extract to umineko project folder (where onscripter exe is)
3) run the umineko-project-steam-stub.exe
4) profit!

this is simple stuff took me only about 20 minutes but felt like sharing anyways

# things i MIGHT consider adding in the future

- [ ] current episode/chapter in discord rpc
- [ ] steam achievement support
